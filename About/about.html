            - I enjoy building software and web pages. My main focus is on C++, I love the low-level control, power, and efficiency it offers. At the same time, I like to switch to web development to clear my head and quickly create simple, fast projects. <br><br>
            - I believe in continuous learning and make it a priority to expand my skills every day. I value clean, efficient code and enjoy working on both the creative and technical sides of development. <br><br>
             -I'm always excited to take on new challenges and grow as a developer.
