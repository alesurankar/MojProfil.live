            C++ is my main language because I like understanding how things work under the hood — 
            memory, performance, and data flow. <br><br>

            I also spend time building web projects, mostly as a way to experiment and move fast.
            Compared to C++, web development lets me prototype ideas quickly and focus on visuals
            and interaction without heavy setup. <br><br>

            Right now, I'm expanding my breadth of experience with graphics frameworks and GUI application
            development in C++, JavaScript, and Python. <br><br>

            I'm always excited to take on new challenges and grow as a developer.
